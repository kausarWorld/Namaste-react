>> Lets create basic HTML page index.html. VS code uses Emmet it generates some code for us.
        > if we give html:5 it it will give basic html skeleton.Lets create basic page which has headings 
        > using plain html it showing "Hello World" in browser.

>> Lets create same hello world page but we are not using but now we will use javascript .
        > using script tag we write javascript code 
        > how to write javascript to create h1 tag?
        example : 
            <div id="root"></div>
            <script>
                const heading = document.createElement('h1');
                heading.innerHTML = "hellow world  from javascript";
                const root = document.getElementById('root');
                root.appendChild(heading)  
            </script> 

>> Lets create hello world using React
        > Does browser knows React ? Answer :NO
        > Lets get react into our project is using CDN 
        > What is CDN and crossorgin?content delivery network its where react is hosted we are fetching from server 
            There are 2 CDN links for react after inlcuding this CDN my project has super power its first thing to use react in our project.
        > Lets see whats there in CDN there will some random code its all jaavscript code.
            When you write react in console it will show all react functions.
            ðŸ˜„ SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED ðŸ˜„ :
        > Why there are 2 files in react CDN ?
                * First one is core of react (React.development.js).
                * Second one is usedfull for DOM manipulation (react-dom.development.js).
                They made 2 files because it works on different platform. like in mobile browser.
                    Example :In console write (React and React DOM).
        creating a element is core of react
        creating a root and rendering something is job react DOM
        > most costly operation in web browser is DOM manipuation 
        > react gives helper functions to optimize the DOM manipulation
        > second parameter in object create element is for giving attribute ex: (id, class) 
        > we can add style in second parameter      
        example
         index.css
         --------------
        # heading {
            color:red
        }
        App.js 
        -----------------
        const heading = React.createElement({
            "h1", 
            {id:"heading", xyz:"abc"},
            "hello world from react"
        })
        console.log(heading)
        const root = React.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
        root.render(heading)

        > what heading console will give it will not give html tag it will give object that is react element.
        ex :console.log(heading)
        it has props  (text is children and  attributes are inside react )
        > we should know EOD react.createElement is object
        > job of root.render is to convert heading object to h1 tag and render in DOM.

        > html structure is not one or 2 tab but its complex structure its nested structure
            ex: 
            <div id="parent">
                <div id="child">
                    <h1></h1>
                </div>
            </div>
        > creating nested element is by adding react element to third attribute.
        example
        --------------------------------
        const parent = React.createElement(
            "div",
            {id:"parent"},
            React.createElement(
                "div",
                {id:"child"},
                [
                    React.createElement("h1",{}, "I am in h1 tag"),
                    React.createElement("h1",{}, "I am in h1 tag")
                ]

            )
        )
    
        > If we have to pass nested multiple children then we have to pass in array.
        > To overcome fro this will use will JSX 
        > if we change the order of files like app.js first then CDN it will throw an error on our face ðŸ˜„
        > there are 2 tyoes of CDN development and production
        > if already some html tag and we are render using react what will happens it will overriden (it will get reaplced)
            example :
            <div id="root">
                Kausar is here
            </div>
            it will reaplced with whatever I pass inside render() method.
        > when browser reads html files first will render html tag then it will see react it replace by whatever is there insdie render() method.
        > curious what if I had above and below root div will it get replaced . Answer is No it wont repalce whatever is there 
        > React can be applied to portioin of our application example only for header or footer 
        > Its not full fledge framework so it can pplied to portion of application 
        > React is giving us helper fucntion from which we cnaa develop our application faster.
        > React can work inside small div also so its beautifull.
        > yes we can create large scale application.
